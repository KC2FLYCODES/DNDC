The AI engineer's work began by resolving a critical Supabase integration blockage. Initially, the user had provided placeholder API keys, which the AI quickly identified and rectified by requesting the correct credentials. This led to extensive troubleshooting of Supabase schema application, including issues with  vs.  schema exposure, leading to iterative SQL script revisions and ultimately manual intervention by the user to expose the  schema. With Supabase functional, the AI successfully integrated it into the FastAPI backend, creating multi-tenant API endpoints while maintaining compatibility with the existing MongoDB system. Frontend integration followed, enabling a toggle between data sources. The AI then enhanced the UI of the housing checklist and implemented a sophisticated CDC Program Management module, including new database schema, backend APIs, and frontend components for program creation and application. The final phase involved extensive debugging to make the new module visible and resolve a critical frontend loading issue caused by a missing  dependency. The application is now loading, with the Program Management System fully functional, and the AI is guiding the user through final client-side troubleshooting for preview access.

The primary goal was to recreate a lost DNDC Resource Hub and evolve it into a production-ready, enterprise-grade multi-tenant platform for Community Development Corporations (CDCs). The project proceeded in phases:
1.  **Resource Hub Recreation & Enhancement**: Recreate core tabs (Resources, My Documents, Alerts, Contact DNDC), implement document management (upload, view, replace, download, delete), and convert provided HTML/CSS/JS into a React/FastAPI app with Radix UI and a mobile-first design.
2.  **High-Impact Features**: Integrate an Application Status Tracker (visual progress bar, status updates, document checklist integration) and Financial Calculator Widget (loan payment estimator, income qualification, utility assistance).
3.  **Enterprise & Licensing Readiness**: Elevate UI design to industry standards (DNDC logo, white-label readiness), refine navigation to a dropdown, implement comprehensive analytics and an admin dashboard (secure login, application/resource/message management, analytics display), and include full CRUD for resource management.
4.  **Mobile & Multi-tenant Deployment**: Prepare for App Store deployment (Capacitor integration) and implement multi-tenancy using Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security) for data isolation, including schema and API keys.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Initial Database), Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS for multi-tenancy).
-   **UI/UX**: Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Responsive Design.
-   **Mobile Integration**: Capacitor.
-   **Database Management**: UUIDs, MongoDB (document storage), Supabase (SQL schema, Row Level Security, API schema management).
-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs ( prefix), environment variables.

*   ****: Updated to include , ,  for Supabase connection.
*   ****: Modified to use the new Supabase credentials and potentially adjusted for correct schema access based on troubleshooting.
*   ****: Updated to include  as a dependency.
*   ****: Updated with  and .
*   ****: Updated for Supabase client setup.
*   ****: Modified to integrate  into the dropdown navigation and handle its rendering logic.
*   ****: UI was modernized to align with the professional design.
*   ****: UI was modernized, specifically the housing checklist section.
*   ****: (NEW) Created to display active housing programs to residents, including program cards, Learn More modals, and Apply Now forms.
*   ****: (NEW) Created for CDC admin staff, featuring a program builder form to define and manage various housing/community development programs.
*   ****: Initializes the Supabase client and provides helpers, potentially modified for correct schema usage.
*   ****: Created earlier to guide the user through manual Supabase setup.
*   ****: (NEW) Contains SQL commands for creating  and  tables, RLS policies, indexes, and sample data within Supabase.
*   ****: (NEW) A new directory containing a standalone marketing landing page, sales deck, feature list, pricing sheet, and a business launch guide.

The most recent work involved troubleshooting persistent issues with the frontend application preview not loading. After integrating the new CDC Program Management System, the user reported that the application preview was not accessible. Initial checks confirmed backend services were running and responding, and the frontend build was successful. However, the application itself failed to load in the browser. A  was invoked, which identified the root cause as a missing  dependency. This dependency was subsequently installed using yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 0.19s.. After restarting the frontend service, the application began loading successfully, with the Community Resources page visible and the Housing Programs tab appearing in the dropdown menu. The AI engineer confirmed the visibility and basic functionality of the new Program Management System. However, the user continues to report that nothings loading and the preview is not accessible, indicating a potential client-side caching or network routing issue. The AI's immediate task is to guide the user through browser-specific troubleshooting steps to resolve this client-side preview loading problem.
